Hi! Welcome to Xinyin Ma(马欣尹)'s website :laughing:!  
I am currently a Ph.D student in [Language and Vision Lab @ NUS](http://www.lv-nus.org/) from August 2022, advised by [Prof.Xinchao Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/). Previously I obtained my master in computer science from Zhejiang University where I was advised by [Prof.Weiming Lu](https://scholar.google.co.id/citations?hl=no&user=H42slBQAAAAJ). I did a bachelor in software engineering also in Zhejiang University and got the honor degree from Chu Kochen Honors College. 

I'm currently conducting some research in efficient learning, including 
* The efficiency of the large lanaguage model
* The acceleration of training: dataset distillation and coreset.
* Compression under low-resource setting. 

Updates
=====
* 2023.5.22: Release LLM-Pruner:llama:, the first structural pruning work of LLM. See our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11627) and [code](https://github.com/horseee/LLM-Pruner)!
* 2023.2.28: One paper 'DepGraph: Towards Any Structural Pruning' accepted by CVPR‘23.
* 2022.4.21: One paper 'Prompting to distill: Boosting Data-Free Knowledge Distillation via Reinforced Prompt' accepted by IJCAI’22.
* 2022.3.31: Obtain my master degree from ZJU.
